# 🎮 Atari Breakout Game in 8086 Assembly (COAL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a recreation of the classic **Atari Breakout Arcade Game**, developed using **8086 Assembly Language** for the Computer Organization and Assembly Language (COAL) course.  
The game features real-time ball movement, paddle control, score handling, and collision detection.

---

## 🕹 Game Objective
Control the paddle using keyboard input to bounce the ball and break all the bricks on the top of the screen.  
Avoid missing the ball — otherwise, it’s Game Over!

---

## 🚀 Features
- Smooth ball movement & collision mechanics  
- Keyboard-controlled paddle (Left/Right arrows)  
- Score tracking  
- Simple graphics using BIOS interrupts  
- Game over condition implemented  
- Optimized register handling
